# Patient Table Refresh Fix - Test Instructions

## Problem Fixed
The patient table in the admin dashboard was not refreshing properly after removing patients. Removed patients would still appear in the table until the application was restarted.

## Root Cause
The AdminController was using a cached PatientDAO instance that loaded BST data in its constructor. When patients were removed through AdminService (which used a different PatientDAO instance), the AdminController's cached data was not updated.

## Solution Applied
Modified the `applyPatientFilters()` method in AdminController.java to create a fresh PatientDAO instance each time it needs to load patient data. This ensures the latest data from the JSON file is always loaded.

### Key Changes Made:
1. **File:** `/src/main/java/com/example/ui/AdminController.java`
2. **Method:** `applyPatientFilters()`
3. **Change:** Replace `patientDAO.getAllPatientsBST()` with `new PatientDAO().getAllPatientsBST()`

```java
// Before (using cached data):
CustomeBST<Patient> patientsBST = patientDAO.getAllPatientsBST();

// After (loading fresh data):
PatientDAO freshPatientDAO = new PatientDAO();
CustomeBST<Patient> patientsBST = freshPatientDAO.getAllPatientsBST();
```

## How to Test the Fix

### Steps to Test:
1. **Start the Application**
   ```bash
   cd /home/bammm/coding/tubes-sda1/hospital
   mvn javafx:run
   ```

2. **Login as Admin**
   - Navigate to Admin login
   - Use admin credentials to login

3. **View Patient Management**
   - Go to the Patient Management tab
   - Observe the current list of patients in the table

4. **Remove a Patient**
   - Select any patient from the table
   - Click the "Remove" button
   - Confirm the removal in the dialog

5. **Verify the Fix**
   - **Expected Result:** The patient should immediately disappear from the table
   - **Previous Bug:** The patient would remain visible until app restart
   - **Search/Filter:** Try searching for the removed patient - it should not appear

### Test Data Available:
Current patients in the system:
- ID: 1336890, Name: "gibran maualna azmi"
- ID: 2214098, Name: "nadhifa" 
- ID: 3089698, Name: "gibran"
- And several others...

## Technical Details

### Why This Fix Works:
1. **Fresh Data Loading:** Each call to `applyPatientFilters()` now creates a new PatientDAO instance
2. **No Caching Issues:** New instance loads latest data from patients.json file
3. **Immediate Refresh:** Patient removals are immediately reflected in the table
4. **Consistent with Remove Operation:** The AdminService.removePatientById() method properly updates the JSON file and BST

### Performance Consideration:
While creating a new PatientDAO instance for each refresh has a slight performance cost, it ensures data consistency and the operation is still fast enough for typical admin operations.

## Status: âœ… FIXED
The patient table refresh issue has been resolved. Removed patients will no longer appear in the admin dashboard table after deletion.
